        <summary>What is The Elven Historical Chronicle?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Elven Historical Chronicle is a fan-created, non-commercial compilation of Azeroth’s elven lore—blending official Blizzard canon with hundreds of player-driven narratives. It’s presented “in-character” as one chronicler’s imperfect account, so you’re encouraged to question or debate any entry. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I contribute my character’s story?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            <li>Go to Apply, fill out the intake form, and submit.</li> 
            <li>You’ll get a Discord message when your form is reviewed.</li> 
            <li>We’ll schedule several interview sessions to flesh out details.</li> 
            <li>After editing, your material will likely appear in the next upcoming edition.</li>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            Most players end up needing roughly 6-18 hours of roleplay to complete the interview, depending on how in depth the character's history is, and also how old the
            character is. Given that it takes so long for each character, the wait for interview slots can be somewhat lengthy, but since this is a one-man project, there is 
            currently, no other way to approach the process without diminishing the quality of the project.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this site endorsed by Blizzard Entertainment?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. This is an entirely fan-created, non-commercial project. All Blizzard IP remains their property. For more information about the terms and technical details,
            please see the <a href="info.html#terms">Terms</a> page and reach out if you have further questions on this matter.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why are some events are listed as happening in a different order than in game?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            World of Warcraft’s storylines often change mid-development, and many quests run in parallel. To keep a smooth, chronological narrative, the Chronicle sometimes interleaves or reorders events—especially in 
            Legion and BfA zones—based on the chronicler’s best understanding. </p>
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I include my character in events that are mentioned?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
           Yes and no. Some events are original guild or community events thare are closed to the public. Your character can certainly be affected by those events, but unless they had direct involvement with that group, or 
           the group has given blanket permission for characters to claim they were involved, then it will not be recognized. The intent is to make the Chronicle a <strong>real</strong> account of roleplay history, not just
           making up extra things to seem cooler. </p>
           <p>
           A prime example of this is the accounts of two Quel'dorei sailor captains whose characters helped evacuate survivors from Quel'Thalas during the Third War. They've given express permission for anyone to claim their
           characters were present aboard those ships in order to escape. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can people be removed from the Chronicle for bad behavior?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            While the Chronicle does not police real-world conduct, any known abusers or predators are not invited to participate. If someone is already included, removals can only occur in the next edition (due to the time required to update all references),
            and are therefore not guarenteed. The continued presence of any such known bad actor's character story is in no way a reflection or endorsement by the creator of the Chronicle.
        </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if someone mentions my character and I don't want to be involved?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            In order for any player-character (PC) name to be featured in the Chronicle, the player must consent to it. Full stop.</p>
            <p></p>
            If consent cannot be gained (for whatever reason), then the name will be modified to something generic, like the relation of said character to the person being interviewed.
        </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can my character reference things from the Chronicle?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, absolutely. The Chronicle is intended as an in-world fan-lore asset, meaning your characters can acquire the volumes in the world of Azeroth, reference events from the text, recognize characters from
            parts of their story, and draw conclusions about certain events based on what they've read. Whether your character believes it or not is another thing entirely. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            The hope is that roleplayers will be able to use the Chronicle to help deepen their RP experiences, and that it can lead to new sorts of interactions and opportunities, especially with the upcoming expansion: 
            World of Warcraft: Midnight. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What happens if a character claims to be Arthas' uncle Bob?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            There are some limitations on what is allowed into the Chronicle. Events that the chronicler is suspicious about, and deems dubious, can always be regarded as such in the text...but if it's outlandishly absurd, 
            then no, it will not be included. If players routinely attempt to get in trollish content like that, they'll be disinvited from the project.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Some of these events didn't happen; why are they in there?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Any events present in the Chronicle are the accounts of players across the entirety of World of Warcraft's roleplay community, including multiple servers and both factions. Just because you
            were not present for those events, or because they're not official canon events, that does not mean they were't happening elsewhere. Hundreds of players have been interviewed and included 
            in the Chronicle, and hundreds more are still going through that process. Between all of those people, there's a whole lot of new fan lore to read up on.
        </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do you keep all this information organized when writing?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
           Prior editions of the Chronicle are used as an essential road map. Now that the heavy lifting of adding all these major canon lore events, it's really just a simple process of figuring out 
           the most appropriate place for things to have occured. Aside from that, there is a massive (almost 600 columns) spreadsheet with most of the character lore events from the intake process.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Who gets to decide if someone's character art gets included?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
           This is determined on a case by case basis, and often depends on how many pages exist in the Chronicle since the last image was used (helps to break up the text). Character art is suggested all the time by 
           people going through the interview process, but the process of selecting which art makes the cut is very strict to ensure a common thematic feel and quality.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can my character buy a copy in game?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes! For RP purposes, any character could purchase a copy of the Chronicle from a bookstore, or find it at an archive or in a library.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>I have updates for my character since I was originally interviewed; what do?!</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Please DM the chronicler on Discord with your character’s name and the updates; we’ll incorporate them into the next volume.
        </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I get my character's story removed?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            As per the terms of agreement that each player consents to before the interviews begin: "Each character writer or rights holder who grants permission to include their story hereby grants an <strong>irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, 
            royalty-free license</strong> for that material to appear in the Chronicle. Such permission <em>cannot</em> be withdrawn or rescinded once given." </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            Now that said, you are always welcome to reach out via Discord and ask about having a character's story removed, it just can't be assured given the hours it would take the rewrite all the entries your character might have been mentioned in,
            and even if that were agreed to, it would not come to be effective until the release of the next edition of the Chronicle.
        </p>

      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is this connected to the World of Warcraft: Chronicle series?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. This is an entirely separate work with no relation whatsoever. Although shortened sometimes to "Chronicle", the Elven Historical Chronicle is a uniquely fan-made creation with no association with Blizzard.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I report an error or typo in the Chronicle?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We strive for accuracy! If you spot a typo or factual error, please send a DM on Discord with specifics, and the volume and page number. We’ll review and correct it in the next edition.

            While you may not re-publish or host the Chronicle on other websites, you are
            welcome to download the PDFs for personal use, print your own copies, or read

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The player behind Ansinosth Summerbough is a long time roleplayer who has been playing World of Warcraft since original launch, and has been running roleplay guilds since the late 2000s. Outside of the 
            Warcraft roleplay scene, the player is a full time school teacher and author.

        <summary>Is Ansinosth a real character?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, Ansinosth is a real character, and present on numerous servers in game. For practicality, multiple versions exist on both factions to facilitate in game interviews, but the main character is on Moon Guard (rp-us).
