        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
      
        <p>
          The Elven Historical Chronicle is a fan-created work of fiction. All names,
          characters, images, and other intellectual property not owned by the
          Chronicle’s creator remain the property of their respective rights
          holders (including, but not limited to, Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.).
          Permission to quote or adapt these materials has been granted solely for
          inclusion in this non-commercial project and does not transfer ownership
          of the underlying works.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Each character writer or rights holder who grants permission to include
          their story hereby grants an <strong>irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide,
          royalty-free license</strong> for that material to appear in the Chronicle.
          Such permission <em>cannot</em> be withdrawn or rescinded once given. The
          Chronicle’s creator, however, retains the unilateral right to remove,
          modify or limit the availability of any content at any time and for any
          reason.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          By accessing or using this site, you acknowledge that you hold no rights
          in the original stories beyond the express license described above. Any
          disputes or inquiries regarding permissions should be directed via Discord
          to <strong>@silvertongue_scribe</strong>.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          You further agree that any claim, controversy, or dispute arising out of
          or relating to this site or its contents shall be submitted to binding
          arbitration and resolved privately, rather than in court. All users
          consent to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration
          Association (or a similar body, if outside the U.S.) and waive any right
          to a trial by jury or class action.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the Chronicle’s creator’s
          place of residence, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section id="volunteer" class="text-block">
        <h2>Volunteer Terms</h2>
      
        <p>
          All work contributed to The Elven Historical Chronicle is provided
          voluntarily and without expectation of payment or royalties, unless
          a separate written agreement specifies otherwise.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Volunteers may withdraw their participation at any time. However, any
          materials, text, artwork, or other contributions submitted prior to
          withdrawal are granted to the Chronicle’s creator under an
          <strong>irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license</strong>
          and remain the Chronicle’s property.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Before including any story elements, characters, or other content owned
          by third-party authors, volunteers must secure permission from the
          original rights holders. Any failure to do so is the sole responsibility
          of the volunteer; the Chronicle’s creator assumes no liability for such
          omissions.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Any volunteer whose conduct is found to undermine the Chronicle’s
          purpose, integrity, or community may be removed from the project
          immediately and without appeal. Serious violations may be referred to
          appropriate legal or arbitration channels.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          If you’d like to volunteer or have questions about contributing,
          please reach out on Discord to <strong>@silvertongue_scribe</strong>.
